This should cause you to reach failure within the 5-7 rep range. Upon reaching failure, immediately\ncut the weight in half and proceed into the second half of the set. Here; you will attempt to complete at least twice as many reps as you\ndid in the first half, before reaching failure. Remember, the rest time between halves of the doubling set is just as long as it takes you to\ncut the weight in half. 60 second rest is allowed between completed doubling sets.\nYour rest time within Doubling Sets is just enough time to cut the weight in half and transition into the second half of the set.\nRest time between completed Doubling Sets is 60 seconds."},
